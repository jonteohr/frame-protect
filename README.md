# Frame Protector
Minimal plugin that locks item frames to their owner

## Description
Very basic and minimalistic plugin that protects item frames to their owner.

Simply put, when a player puts down a Item Frame, it will be locked/protected to that player. Only the player can remove it, put and item on it and/or rotate said item.

## Permissions
| Permission | Description |
| --- | --- |
|**frameprotector.override**| Players with this permission overrides the protection. Basically good for admins/mods. |
|**frameprotector.ignore**| Players with this permission will not have their item frames protected. They can still not interact with other locked item frames- |

#### Note
_Saw that there was a similar plugin to this uploaded, however it was not updated and according to reviews it crashed servers. So I made my own real quick._
